== Implementation details of germanet-gpl module

=== Conversion of !GermaNets Interlingual index to !SenseAxes

==== Informations of  an ILIRecord (each record mapped to !SenseAxis)

|====
| GermaNet identifier | Remark | Mapped to | Implemented? |

| lexUnitId 
| id of !GermaNets lexical unit 
| not directly mapped, but used for obtaining the corresponding UBY-LMF !LexicalEntry and determining values of !SenseAxis.synsetOne and !SenseAxis.senseOne 
| Yes

| ewnRelation 
| the relation of the record to the corresponding !WordNets synset 
| Not directly mapped, but used for determining which record should be converted to !SenseAxis instance(s). 
| Yes

| pwnWord 
| string representation of the word in !WordNets synset pointed by the record 
| already mapped and implemented in WNConverter to !LexicalEntry.Lemma.!FormRepresentation.writtenForm 
| -

| pwn20Sense 
| position of the word in !WordNets 2.0 synset pointed by the record 
| already mapped and implemented in !WNConverter to Sense.index 
| -

| pwn20Id 
| identifier of the !WordNets 2.0 synset that corresponds to this record (offset+POS) 
| not mapped 
| -

| pwn30Id 
| identifier of the !WordNets 3.0 synset that corresponds to this record (offset+POS) 
| not directly mapped, but used for obtaining the corresponding UBY-LMF synset and mapping its UBY-LMF ID to !SenseAxis.synsetTwo 
| Yes

| pwn20paraphrase 
| gloss of the targeted synset 
| already mapped and implemented in WNConverter 
| -

| pwn20Synonyms 
| words of !WordNets synset, that corresponds to this record 
| !SenseAxis.senseTwo 
| Yes

| source 
| source of the record (!EuroWordNet or Tübingen University) 
| not mapped 
| -

NOTE: Currently, only ILI Records with ewnRelation "synonym" are processed by the !GNConverter. Conversion of records with ewnRelation other than "synonym" will be implemented in a future UBY release.
