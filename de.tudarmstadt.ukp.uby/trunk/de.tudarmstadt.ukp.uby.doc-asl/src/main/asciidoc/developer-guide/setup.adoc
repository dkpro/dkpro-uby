== Setting up Eclipse and Maven for UBY development

=== Basic Setup (of Eclipse and Maven)

* Follow the [http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/UserSetup user setup] instructions
* If you are in Eclipse, restart it  

If you do not have _settings.xml_ file in your _.m2_ directory, just create one with exactly the same content as in the [http://code.google.com/p/dkpro-core-asl/wiki/UkpMavenRepository Maven setup instructions]. You can also use the _settings.xml_ provided in [http://code.google.com/p/uby/downloads/list Downloads section] and copy it to your _.m2_ folder.

=== Checking out

* Open the *SVN Repositories perspective* in Eclipse (Menu -> Window -> Show View -> Other... -> SVN -> SVN Repositories)
* *Add* a SVN repository with the URL http://uby.googlecode.com/svn/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.uby
* *Expand* the new repository node in the SVN Repositories view
* Right-click on *trunk* and select *Check out as Maven project*
+
NOTE: if you do not see this menu item, make sure you have installed the Maven SCM handler for Subclipse. 
+
* (optional) Eclipse will create some projects now. We recommend to group these projects into a working set:
** Select *Next*
** Check *Add project(s) to working set*
** Click *More...*
** Click *New...*
** Double-click *Java*
** Enter the working set name Uby
** Click *Finish*
** Click *OK*
** Select the working set Uby from the working set drop-down box
+
NOTE: when you are completely through with these and the following steps, remember to go to the Package Explorer view. There is a small triangular icon in its top right corner. Click on that and select Top Level Elements -> Working Sets. 
+
* Click *Finish.*
