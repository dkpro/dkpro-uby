== UBY databases for Download

The UBY databases we offer for download *contain only resources with an open license*. 

The compressed SQL database dumps and H2 databases are available from the link:http://uby.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uby[UBY homepage]. 

The largest database dump uby_open_XXX contains the following resources:

* !FrameNet
* !WordNet
* !OmegaWiki German
* !OmegaWiki English
* Wikipedia English
* Wikipedia German
* !VerbNet
* Wiktionary English
* Wiktionary German
* !OntoWiktionary English
* !OntoWiktionary German 
* Monolingual Sense Alignments between
** Wikipedia EN and !WordNet
** Wiktionary EN and !WordNet
** !WordNet and  !VerbNet
** !WordNet and !FrameNet
** !FrameNet and  !VerbNet
** !FrameNet and Wiktionary EN
** Wiktionary EN and !OmegaWiki EN
** !OmegaWiki DE and Wikipedia DE
** !OmegaWiki EN and Wikipedia EN
* Crosslingual Sense Alignments between
** !OmegaWiki DE and !WordNet
** !OmegaWiki DE and !OmegaWiki EN
** Wikipedia EN and  Wikipedia DE

Databases marked as _medium_ do not contain Wikipedia (DE and EN) and !OntoWiktionary (DE and EN), but the other resources and links listed above.

The H2 database marked _lite_ only contains !WordNet, !FrameNet, !VerbNet and the alignments between them.

The suffixes in the names of the UBY databases correspond to a version number of UBY. These numbers should agree. For instance, the uby_medium_0_6_0 dump is compatible with the UBY-API 0.6.0

The databases were automatically created by running the respective converters for each resource and import routines for the sense alignments.

=== How to use a UBY H2 database

Just uncompress the UBY H2 database and put it into a folder of your choice. 

In order to connect to this database you have to specify the path:

----
DB_URL =  "jdbc:h2:file:YOUR_PATH/ubymedium060";
----

and the other configuration parameters as follows:

[source,java]
----
DB_DRIVER = "org.h2.Driver";
DB_DRIVER_NAME = "h2";
	
DB_USERNAME = "sa";
DB_PASSWORD = "";

DBConfig db = new DBConfig(
	            DB_URL,
	            DB_DRIVER,
	            DB_DRIVER_NAME,
	            DB_USERNAME,
	            DB_PASSWORD,
	            false
	    );
----

=== How to import the UBY MySQL dump

*This assumes that you have installed MySQL-Server*

After downloading and uncompressing the SQL dump, just import the file into a newly created, empty database. Note that the dump was created from a MySQL database. While it should work on any other SQL database, we have only tested it on MySQL.

Step-by-step instructions for importing the dump into a MySQL database under Linux:

----
mysql -u yourUserName -p < pathToUbyDump/ubyDump.sql
----

After the import is finished, you are ready to use the UBY-API.
For the medium-sized UBY dump, the import takes ca. 30 min. The import of the large UBY dump takes several hours.
