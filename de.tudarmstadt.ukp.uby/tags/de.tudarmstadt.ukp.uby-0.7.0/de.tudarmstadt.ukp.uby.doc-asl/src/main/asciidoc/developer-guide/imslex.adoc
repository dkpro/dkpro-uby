== Preprocessing steps for IMSlex-Subcat data

=== General Information

The current Java converter covers the following IMSlex-Subcat data:

* `Subcat_ADJ.txt`
* `Subcat_NN.txt`
* `Subcat_PartV.txt`
* `Subcat_V.txt`

`Subcat_ADV.txt` will be covered in a future UBY release.

Notes on the verb files `Subcat_V.txt` and `Subcat_PartV.txt`:
 * in `Subcat_V.txt`, there are verbs without subcat frame; these are not imported into UBY.
 * in `Subcat_PartV.txt`, the auxiliary is specified; this is currently not imported into UBY, but will be covered in a future UBY release.

Note on the `Subcat_NN.txt` file: nouns with the following specifications have not been considered (very noisy):
 * `(ntype(app))`
 * `(ntype(app-buchst-zahl))`
 * `(ntype(beruf))`
 * `(ntype(name))`
 * `(ntype(name-det))`



=== Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps convert the IMSlex-Subcat data into the target format required by the UBY Java converter:

----
lemma%pos%subcat-frame%semantic-class-information
----

On the command line, execute the following commands:

Step 1: filtering and creating input format for Perl script.

----
gawk '{print $1 " noun " $2 " null"}' Subcat_NN.txt | sort -u > nouns
gawk '{print $1 " adj " $2 " null"}' Subcat_ADJ.txt | sort -u > adjectives
gawk '{print $1 " verb " $3 " null"}' Subcat_PartV.txt | sort -u > particleVerbs
gawk '$2 ~ /\s/ {print $1 " verb " $2 " null"}' Subcat_V.txt | sort -u > nonParticleVerbs
----

Step 2: concatenating all files:

----
cat adjectives nouns nonParticleVerbs particleVerbs | sort -u > imsLexSubcat
----

Step 3: running the [http://code.google.com/p/uby/downloads/detail?name=IMSlex2converterInput&can=2&q=#makechanges Perl script] availble in the Downloads section.

----
perl IMSlex2converterInput imsLexSubcat
----

result file: `imsLexConverterInput`
